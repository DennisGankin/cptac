This is the cptac testing package to make sure that all the datasets are functioning properly.

# Testing Package Development
- While we are making this package, `./old` will house all the past tests with hard coded values.
- Caleb recently started making dynamic tests.
- Corbin and Robert are continuing these efforts and will use `new_tests.py` as a reference.

### The goal of this package is to have a complete testing suite with a unique *script.py* file for each type of test, which will all be run by a master script.

- We will be building our test package on top of the `PyTest` package.
