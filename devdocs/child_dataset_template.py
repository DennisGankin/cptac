# HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE FILE
#
# To make a class for a new dataset, copy this file and fill in the indicated
# sections, as described below.
#
# This file has sections marked with the word FILL, usually in triple quotes or
# preceded by three hashtags (###). To adapt this file for a new dataset,
# replace all of those marked fields with the proper values for your dataset.
# Additionally, there are some example code sections marked with START EXAMPLE 
# CODE and END EXAMPLE CODE. You need to replace the example code with the
# proper code for processing your dataset.
#
# This file uses dataframe processing functions imported from
# cptac/dataframe_tools.py. For more information on how to use those functions,
# you can read their docstrings in that file.
#
# If there's something confusing about this file, look at the files for existing
# datasets to provide examples of how this file would actually be implemented.
# If the new dataset you're adding has something weird that isn't addressed in
# this file, check the other datasets to see if any of them deal with a similar
# issue.

###FILL: Put in the actual name/acronym for the cancer type as the class name in the line below, in UpperCamelCase.
### For example, the endometrial dataset's class is called Endometrial; the BRCA dataset's class is called Brca; and the ccRCC dataset's class is called Ccrcc.

    def __init__(self, version="latest", no_internet=False):
        """Load all of the dataframes as values in the self._data dict variable, with names as keys, and format them properly.

        Parameters:
        version (str, optional): The version number to load, or the string "latest" to just load the latest building. Default is "latest".
        no_internet (bool, optional): Whether to skip the index update step because it requires an internet connection. This will be skipped automatically if there is no internet at all, but you may want to manually skip it if you have a spotty internet connection. Default is False.
        """

        # Set some needed variables, and pass them to the parent Dataset class __init__ function

        # This keeps a record of all versions that the code is equipped to handle. That way, if there's a new data release but they didn't update their package, it won't try to parse the new data version it isn't equipped to handle.

        # Get a union of all dataframes' indices, with duplicates removed
        ###FILL: If there are any tables whose index values you don't want
        ### included in the master index, pass them to the optional 'exclude'
        ### parameter of the unionize_indices function. This was useful, for
        ### example, when some datasets' followup data files included samples
        ### from cohorts that weren't in any data tables besides the followup
        ### table, so we excluded the followup table from the master index since
        ### there wasn't any point in creating empty representative rows for
        ### those samples just because they existed in the followup table.
        master_index = unionize_indices(self._data) 

        # Use the master index to reindex the clinical dataframe, so the clinical dataframe has a record of every sample in the dataset. Rows that didn't exist before (such as the rows for normal samples) are filled with NaN.
        new_clinical = self._data["clinical"]
        new_clinical = new_clinical.reindex(master_index)

        # Add a column called Sample_Tumor_Normal to the clinical dataframe indicating whether each sample was a tumor or normal sample. Use a function from dataframe_tools to generate it.

        ###FILL: Your dataset should have some way that it marks the Patient IDs
        ### of normal samples. The example code below is for a dataset that
        ### marks them by putting an 'N' at the beginning of each one. You will
        ### need to write a lambda function that takes a given Patient_ID string
        ### and returns a bool indicating whether it corresponds to a normal
        ### sample. Pass that lambda function to the 'normal_test' parameter of
        ### the  generate_sample_status_col function when you call it. See 
        ### cptac/dataframe_tools.py for further function documentation.
        ###START EXAMPLE CODE###################################################
        sample_status_col = generate_sample_status_col(new_clinical, normal_test=lambda sample: sample[0] == 'N')
        ###END EXAMPLE CODE#####################################################

        new_clinical.insert(0, "Sample_Tumor_Normal", sample_status_col)

        # Replace the clinical dataframe in the data dictionary with our new and improved version!
        self._data['clinical'] = new_clinical

        # Edit the format of the Patient_IDs to have normal samples marked the same way as in other datasets. 
        
        ###FILL: You will need to pass the proper parameters to correctly
        ### reformat the patient IDs in your dataset. The standard format is to
        ### have the string '.N' appended to the end of the normal patient IDs,
        ### e.g. the  normal patient ID corresponding to C3L-00378 would be
        ### C3L-00378.N (this way we can easily match two samples from the same
        ### patient). The example code below is for a dataset where all the
        ### normal samples have  an "N" prepended to the patient IDs. The
        ### reformat_normal_patient_ids function erases that and puts a ".N" at
        ### the end. See cptac/dataframe_tools.py for further function
        ### documentation.
