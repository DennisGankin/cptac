    "\n",
    "The National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) is a national effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the application of large-scale proteome and genome analysis, or proteogenomics. CPTAC generates comprehensive proteomics and genomics data from clinical cohorts, typically with ~100 samples per tumor type. The graphic below summarizes the structure of each CPTAC dataset. For more information, visit the [NIH website](https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac). \n",

    "This Python package makes accessing CPTAC data easy with Python code and Jupyter notebooks. The package contains several tutorials which demonstrate data access and usage. This first tutorial serves as an introduction to the data to help users become familiar with what is included and how it is presented."
